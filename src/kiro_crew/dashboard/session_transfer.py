"""Session transfer — copy a session between Kiro Crew instances.

Two halves live here:

* :func:`build_transfer_bundle` serialises one slot's visible conversation into
  a portable, version-tagged dict. Called on the **sending** side.
* :func:`api_chat_slot_import` accepts such a dict and materialises it as a new
  slot. Called on the **receiving** side.

The wire hop between them is an ordinary authenticated dashboard request over
an Instances tunnel; see [instances.md](../../../docs/system-specs/modules/instances.md) §14.

**Copy, never move.** Import always allocates a NEW slot key and never touches
an existing session, so a transfer leaves the source intact and can be repeated
safely. Nothing here deletes anything.

**What deliberately does NOT travel.** A session's transcript is portable text,
but most of its *metadata* is a reference into the local instance's object graph
— a project path, a folder id, a workspace's memory, an agent template, a bound
artifact. Carrying those across would produce dangling references that render
as broken UI on arrival, so the bundle carries the transcript, the title, and an
agent *hint* only:

* ``project`` is intentionally dropped. The source's checkout path almost never
  exists on the target host (a Mac worktree path on a Linux dev desk), and a
  slot pointing at a missing directory scopes file search and steering to
  nothing. The imported session arrives with no project so the user re-picks it.
* ``model`` is not carried. Accounts differ in entitlement, so a model id that
  the source account is served can fail at runtime on the target; the target
  resolves its own default instead (see AGENTS.md § Model selection).
* ``workspace`` is not carried. Workspaces are per-instance memory scopes, and a
  name that matches on both hosts still means two different memories.
* ``agent`` is carried as a hint and applied ONLY if the target has an agent by
  that name; otherwise it is dropped rather than left dangling.
* ``folder_id``, ``tags``, ``pinned``, ``artifact``, ``app``,
  ``linked_session_key`` and ``forked_from`` are all local-graph references and
  are not carried at all.

    The transcript read is synchronous file IO plus JSON parsing over a whole
    session, which is exactly the "large synchronous file IO" the
    ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`` rule forbids on the loop: on a long
    session it stalls every other task, and because the liveness heartbeat is
    itself a coroutine a stalled loop cannot pet LoopStallWatchdog, which then
    exits the gateway.

    **Offloading introduces an await, so the snapshot must be checked for
    consistency.** While we are off the loop the periodic 5s flush can run: it
    writes the dirty tail to disk AND advances ``_resumed_count`` / clears
    ``_dirty``. If that lands between our read and our merge, a naive merge reads
    pre-flush disk content and then sees a clean slot — silently dropping the
    tail from the copy.

    Because a completed flush moves ``_dirty`` and ``_resumed_count`` *together*,
    an unchanged pair across the await is positive proof that no flush landed:
    ``history`` then corresponds exactly to ``messages[:_resumed_count]``, so the
    in-memory tail merge is consistent. On a change we retry against the new
    state. Messages arriving during the await are harmless — they extend the tail
    we are about to copy, they do not move the boundary.

    If the retries are exhausted (a flush would have to land inside every one of
    them, which the 5s cadence makes effectively impossible), the last resort
    reads INLINE on the loop: no await means no interleaving, so consistency is
    guaranteed. One blocking read in a pathological case is a strictly better
    failure mode than silently transferring a transcript with turns missing.
